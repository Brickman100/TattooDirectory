# Performance Validation Checklist

This checklist guides the process of validating the performance of the Next.js migration compared to the original React + Vite implementation.

## Bundle Size Analysis

- [ ] Build both applications with production settings
- [ ] Compare total bundle size
- [ ] Compare JavaScript bundle size
- [ ] Compare CSS bundle size
- [ ] Analyze chunk splitting and code splitting
- [ ] Identify opportunities for further optimization

## Lighthouse Audit

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits on key pages:
  - [ ] Landing page
  - [ ] Artist search page
  - [ ] Artist profile page
  - [ ] Static pages (Privacy, Terms, etc.)
- [ ] Compare performance scores
- [ ] Compare accessibility scores
- [ ] Compare best practices scores
- [ ] Compare SEO scores
- [ ] Compare Core Web Vitals metrics:
  - [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - [ ] Total Blocking Time (TBT)
  - [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] Document any significant differences

## Loading Performance

- [ ] Test initial page load time for key pages
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Measure time to interactive
- [ ] Measure first paint and first contentful paint
- [ ] Test with different network conditions (fast, slow, etc.)
- [ ] Test with different device capabilities (high-end, low-end)
- [ ] Document any significant differences

## Optimization Opportunities

- [ ] Identify components that could benefit from further optimization
- [ ] Check for unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Verify proper use of Next.js features:
  - [ ] Image optimization
  - [ ] Font optimization
  - [ ] Script optimization
- [ ] Check for proper code splitting
- [ ] Verify lazy loading of components where appropriate

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Both applications must be built with production settings
2. For comparative tests, both applications must be running:
   - Next.js app on http://localhost:3000
   - Vite app on http://localhost:5173

### Bundle Size Analysis

```bash
node scripts/run-performance-validation.js bundle
```

### Lighthouse Audits

```bash
node scripts/run-performance-validation.js lighthouse
```

### Loading Performance Tests

```bash
node scripts/run-performance-validation.js loading
```

### All Tests

```bash
node scripts/run-performance-validation.js all
```

## Results

All test results are saved to the `performance-results` directory. Review these results to identify:

1. Areas where Next.js outperforms the original implementation
2. Areas where further optimization is needed
3. Any regressions that need to be addressed

Document your findings and recommendations for further optimization in the migration notes.
