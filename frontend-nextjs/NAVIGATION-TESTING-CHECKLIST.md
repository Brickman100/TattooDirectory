# Navigation Testing Checklist

This checklist guides the process of validating the navigation functionality of the Next.js migration.

## Internal Navigation

### Link Testing
- [ ] Test all navigation menu links
- [ ] Test all in-page links
- [ ] Test all button navigations
- [ ] Verify correct active state on navigation items
- [ ] Test breadcrumb navigation (if applicable)

### Routing
- [ ] Verify all routes render the correct components
- [ ] Test dynamic routes with different parameters
- [ ] Verify URL parameters are correctly parsed
- [ ] Test query parameters functionality
- [ ] Verify route changes update the browser history

### Browser Navigation
- [ ] Test browser back button functionality
- [ ] Test browser forward button functionality
- [ ] Test browser refresh functionality
- [ ] Verify state persistence during navigation
- [ ] Test deep linking (directly accessing nested routes)

## URL Handling

### URL Structure
- [ ] Verify URL structure matches the expected format
- [ ] Test URL encoding/decoding for special characters
- [ ] Verify trailing slashes are handled correctly
- [ ] Test URL normalization (uppercase vs lowercase)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test navigation to non-existent routes (404)
- [ ] Verify error boundaries catch navigation errors
- [ ] Test recovery from navigation errors

## Performance

### Navigation Speed
- [ ] Measure time between navigation actions
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions between pages
- [ ] Test navigation performance with slow network
- [ ] Verify prefetching works correctly (if applicable)

### Loading States
- [ ] Verify loading indicators appear during navigation
- [ ] Test loading states with slow network conditions
- [ ] Verify loading states are accessible

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Test tab navigation through all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus management during navigation
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify skip links functionality (if applicable)

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Test navigation announcements for screen readers
- [ ] Verify route changes are announced to screen readers
- [ ] Test focus management with screen readers

## Running the Tests

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate through the application using different methods
2. Test with keyboard only
3. Test with screen readers
4. Test with different network conditions

### Automated Testing
Use the provided script to test navigation functionality:

```bash
node scripts/test-navigation.js
```

## Documentation

Document any issues found during testing:
1. Navigation path where the issue occurs
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots or videos if applicable

## Results

All test results are saved to the `navigation-testing-results` directory. Review these results to identify:

1. Navigation issues that need to be addressed
2. Performance improvements for navigation
3. Accessibility issues related to navigation

Document your findings and recommendations for further improvements in the migration notes.
