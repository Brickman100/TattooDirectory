### Automated Testing
Use the provided script to generate screenshots for visual comparison:

```bash
node scripts/cross-browser-testing.js
```

## Documentation

Document any issues found during testing:
1. Browser/device where the issue occurs
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots or videos if applicable

## Results

All test results and screenshots are saved to the `browser-testing-results` directory. Review these results to identify:
