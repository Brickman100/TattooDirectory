# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Tattoo Artist Directory frontend from a React + Vite setup to Next.js. The migration aims to leverage Next.js's built-in optimizations, server-side rendering capabilities, and improved developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality and design patterns.

The current frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The migration should preserve all existing components, styling, and functionality while adapting to Next.js conventions and folder structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from React + Vite to Next.js, so that I can leverage Next.js's built-in optimizations, file-based routing, and better production performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Next.js 14+ with the App Router
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing React components SHALL function identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain TypeScript support with proper type checking
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Tailwind CSS styling SHALL be preserved without visual changes
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN shadcn/ui components SHALL continue to work as expected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to adapt the folder structure to Next.js conventions, so that the project follows Next.js best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the folder structure is updated THEN it SHALL follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions
2. WHEN pages are migrated THEN they SHALL use the new `app/` directory structure
3. WHEN components are organized THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories following Next.js patterns
4. WHEN static assets are moved THEN they SHALL be placed in the `public/` directory at the root level
5. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with Next.js build system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing functionality during migration, so that no features are lost in the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing pages SHALL render correctly
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all interactive components SHALL maintain their functionality
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all API calls and data fetching SHALL work as before
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all routing SHALL function correctly using Next.js App Router
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all styling and responsive design SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the application for production deployment, so that it can be efficiently hosted on AWS S3/CloudFront as a static export.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build configuration is set up THEN Next.js SHALL be configured for static export
2. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL generate static files suitable for S3 hosting
3. WHEN deployed to S3/CloudFront THEN all routes SHALL work correctly with proper fallbacks
4. WHEN the static export is generated THEN it SHALL maintain all functionality without requiring a Node.js server
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL optimize images, CSS, and JavaScript for production

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development workflow efficiency, so that the migration doesn't negatively impact development speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL provide hot reloading for all file types
2. WHEN TypeScript files are edited THEN type checking SHALL provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN components are modified THEN changes SHALL be reflected instantly in the browser
4. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN it SHALL support all existing development tools and extensions
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN source maps SHALL be available and accurate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure compatibility with existing tooling, so that ESLint, Prettier, and other development tools continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint is configured THEN it SHALL work with Next.js and provide appropriate rules
2. WHEN Prettier is set up THEN it SHALL format Next.js files correctly
3. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN it SHALL provide proper intellisense for Next.js features
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN all linting and formatting checks SHALL pass
5. WHEN Git hooks are configured THEN they SHALL work with the new Next.js structure
