# Tattoo Artist Directory MVP

A comprehensive, serverless tattoo artist directory platform built on AWS. This project serves as a technical portfolio piece demonstrating modern full-stack development practices while solving the real-world problem of fragmented tattoo artist discovery.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Tattoo Artist Directory creates the most comprehensive directory of UK tattoo artists by aggregating public data from multiple sources, providing clients with a powerful search tool and artists with a zero-effort marketing channel.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Aggregation**: Multi-source scraping engine (Google Maps ‚Üí Studio Websites ‚Üí Instagram)
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Search by style, location, and keywords with grid and map views
- **Artist Profile Pages**: Comprehensive profiles with portfolios, styles, and contact information
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built on AWS using Lambda, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Step Functions, and Fargate
- **Infrastructure as Code**: 100% Terraform-managed infrastructure with automated CI/CD

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system employs a serverless-first, event-driven architecture with two main components:

1. **Core API & Data Platform** (Phase 1): User-facing services for search and profile display
2. **Async Data Aggregation Engine** (Phase 2): Automated data collection and processing

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js SPA hosted on S3/CloudFront
- **Backend**: API Gateway + Lambda functions
- **Data**: DynamoDB (primary) + OpenSearch (search/filtering)
- **Processing**: Step Functions + Fargate for data aggregation
- **Infrastructure**: AWS services with Terraform IaC
